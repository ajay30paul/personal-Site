About me:
I am a front-end web developer with a  passion for general web development. My journey into this field was born from my desire to combine my creativity with my work. Thanks to my background in design, Photoshop and video editing, I found a way to combine my artistic skills digitally. I am passionate about creating visual and user-friendly websites, using my  skills to translate content into numbers. As I delve deeper into whole group development, I am excited to broaden my horizons and create holistic  solutions that combine my skills with my creative passion.
